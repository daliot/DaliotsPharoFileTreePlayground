I am a station where people can transfer between lines. I have several sub stations. Each sub station represents a station dedicated a single line. For example, line2 and line2-seongsu-branch has its own 'Seongsu' station. Two seongsu station forms a Transfer station of 'Seongsu'. I forwards the name and id to the first of my sub stations.
I don't have a dedicated graphVertex because I have several of them. So I sometimes behave like a composite node in Composite pattern. If you find a station using name or id, JhcLine creates me in case there're two ore more stations have the same name.
